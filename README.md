# COMP9021 (UNSW) — Labs, Practice & Exam Prep

Welcome! This repository contains weekly COMP9021 learning materials, including:
- Lab solutions (often with multiple approaches)
- Practice questions + alternative solutions
- Recommended LeetCode problems for extra practice
- Exam preparation notes

I will update this repo **weekly** throughout the term.

## 📁 Folder Guide (How to find things)

### Lab Solutions
- `Lab01 Solutions/`
- `Lab02 Solutions/`
- ...
- `Lab08 Solutions/`

Each lab folder includes solutions for that week’s lab questions.
Sometimes you will see multiple versions of solutions to show different ways of thinking.

### Practice Questions
- `Practice Questions/`

These are selected practice problems that match the skills used in labs
(e.g. strings, lists, dictionaries, recursion/DFS, file processing, etc.).
They may also include multiple solutions.

### Recommended LeetCode Problems
- `Recommended Leetcode Problems/`

A list of LeetCode problems that reinforce COMP9021 topics.
Use these if you want structured extra practice.

### Exam Preparation
- `Exam Preparation - COMP9021 26T1.md`

Revision notes, checklists, and topic summaries for exam prep.  
I will also run a revision session in the **final tutorial of the term**, and upload the corresponding revision materials here.

## Best way to use this repo

1. **Attempt the lab questions first** (even partial attempts are valuable).
2. Compare with the solutions:
   - Identify what you did differently
   - Note the key idea / pattern used
3. Re-do the question **without looking** after 1–2 days.
4. For weak areas, use `Practice Questions/` and the LeetCode list.

If you only read solutions, improvement will be slow.
If you *try → compare → redo*, improvement will be fast.
