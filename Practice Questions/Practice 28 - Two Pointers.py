"""
Prompts the user for a sequence of uppercase letters and finds the
shortest dictionary words that contain all those letters (in order).

The program:
  1. Keeps only uppercase letters from user input (warns if others exist)
  2. Reads words from 'dictionary.txt' (one uppercase word per line)
  3. Finds all dictionary words that embed the given letters in order
  4. Outputs:
     - A warning if no matching word exists
     - A message if the input itself is a dictionary word
     - A list of all shortest matching words otherwise

Example:
    Input: priceECIRPprice
    Output:
        I only keep the uppercase letters, so work with 'ECIRP'.
        The shortest words in the dictionary that embed 'ECIRP' are:
